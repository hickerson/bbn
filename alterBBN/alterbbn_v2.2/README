INTRODUCTION
------------
The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
https://alterbbn.hepforge.org/

This C code (in C99 standard) provides the calculation of the BBN abundance of the elements in different cosmological frameworks.

The program has been tested on Linux, Mac and Windows machines with gcc, clang and icc.

Installation and Compilation
----------------------------
- tar xzvf alterbbn_vX.X.tgz
- cd alterbbn_vX.X
- in Makefile, define your C compiler
- compile with: make

8 programs are available:
- stand_cosmo.c: calculation of the abundances in the standard cosmological model
- alter_eta.c: calculation in a scenario with a modified baryon-to-photon ratio
- alter_etannutau.c: calculation in a scenario with a modified baryon-to-photon ratio, a different number of neutrinos and a modified neutron lifetime
- alter_neutrinos.c: calculation in a scenario with a different number of neutrinos
- alter_phi.c: calculation in scenario with a decaying scalar field
- alter_reheating.c: calculation in a model with modified expansion rate and reheating
- alter_standmod.c: calculation in a model with modified expansion rate and entropy content
- alter_wimps.c: calculation in a model where WIMPs can alter the nuclear rates

History
-------
v2.0 - 06/29/2018 -     Extended nuclear network.
			Several cases of WIMPs added.
