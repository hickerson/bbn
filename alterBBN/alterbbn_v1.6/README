AlterBBN Version 1.6 (Feb 2016)
-----------------------------------
By Alexandre Arbey (alexandre.arbey@ens-lyon.fr) v1.0 - v1.4
Additions by Kevin Peter Hickerson (hickerson@physics.ucla.edu) v1.5 - v1.6

INTRODUCTION
------------
The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
http://superiso.in2p3.fr/relic/alterbbn

This C code (in C99 standard) provides the calculation of the BBN abundance of the elements in different cosmological framework.

The program has been tested on Linux and Mac machines with gcc and icc.


Installation and Compilation
----------------------------
- tar xzvf alterbbn_vX.X.tgz
- cd alterbbn_vX.X
- in Makefile, define your C compiler
- compile with: make

7 programs are available:
- stand_cosmo.c: calculation of the abundances in the standard cosmological model
- alter_eta.c: calculation in a scenario with a modified baryon-to-photon ratio
- alter_etannutau.c: calculation in a scenario with a modified baryon-to-photon ratio, a different number of neutrinos and a modified neutron lifetime
- alter_neutrinos.c: calculation in a scenario with a different number of neutrinos
- alter_reheating.c: calculation in a reheating-like model
- alter_standmod.c: calculation in a model with modified expansion rate and entropy content
- alter_fierz.c: like etannutau but with an added Fierz interference term in the  n<->p rates

History
-------
v1.6 - 02/29/2016 -     
            Changed all indicies for Reactions and Nuclides to enums
            Improved the readability of some code and comments.
            Instead of arrays, stl maps are now used.

v1.5 - 07/19/2015 -     
            Added calculation Fierz interference term to the n<->p rates. 
            Improved the direct integration section of n<->p.
            Fixed normalizer and added Coulomb correction n lifetime.
            Improved the readability of some code and comments.

v1.4 - 06/28/2013 -     
            Added calculation of the errors, inspired by astro-ph/9803177 (thanks to S. Sarkar).
			Routine prototypes modified.
			Neutrino degeneracy added.

v1.3 - 03/04/2012 -     
            Reaction rate moved to separate file bbnrate.c.
