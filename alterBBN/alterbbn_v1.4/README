AlterBBN Version 1.4 (28 June 2013)
-----------------------------------
By Alexandre Arbey (alexandre.arbey@ens-lyon.fr)


INTRODUCTION
------------
The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
http://superiso.in2p3.fr/relic/alterbbn

This C code (in C99 standard) provides the calculation of the BBN abundance of the elements in different cosmological framework.

The program has been tested on Linux and Mac machines with gcc and icc.


Installation and Compilation
----------------------------
- tar xzvf alterbbn_vX.X.tgz
- cd alterbbn_vX.X
- in Makefile, define your C compiler
- compile with: make

6 programs are available:
- stand_cosmo.c: calculation of the abundances in the standard cosmological model
- alter_eta.c: calculation in a scenario with a modified baryon-to-photon ratio
- alter_etannutau.c: calculation in a scenario with a modified baryon-to-photon ratio, a different number of neutrinos and a modified neutron lifetime
- alter_neutrinos.c: calculation in a scenario with a different number of neutrinos
- alter_reheating.c: calculation in a reheating-like model
- alter_standmod.c: calculation in a model with modified expansion rate and entropy content

History
-------
v1.4 - 06/28/2013 -     Added calculation of the errors, inspired by astro-ph/9803177 (thanks to S. Sarkar).
			Routine prototypes modified.
			Neutrino degeneracy added.

v1.3 - 03/04/2012 -     Reaction rate moved to separate file bbnrate.c.
			Evaluation of errors using low and high rates.
			Several comments modified in the .c files (thanks to A. Mishra).

v1.2 - 07/08/2011 -     Improved p <-> n reaction rate.

v1.1 - 06/20/2011 -     Improved nuclear network.

v1.0 - 06/02/2011 - 	First public release.
