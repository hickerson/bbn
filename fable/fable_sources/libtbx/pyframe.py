      Synopsis:

      from libtbx import pyframe

      def f(i):
        for j in xrange(i):
          g(j)

      def g(j):
        return k(j)

      def k(j):
        f = pyframe.named('f')
        if f.j == 3: ....

      This is particularly useful for conditional breakpoints in the WingIDE debugger.
      Let's say we have a function 'test' which tests a function 'clever_algorithm' and that
      one wants to put a breakpoint in the latter that only triggers
      for one particular test (that we know is going to fail e.g.). Let's say tests are
      identified by a local variable 'idx' in function 'test'. Then we can put a conditional
      breakpoint somewhere in function 'clever_algorithm' like so:

        pyframe.named('test').idx == 5

      The advantage of conditional tests is that they don't require modifying code for
      debugging purposes, which is always a dangerous thing to do as one may inadvertantly
      leave debugging code in.
